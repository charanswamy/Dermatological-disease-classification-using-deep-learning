# Dermatological-disease-classification-using-deep-learning

Skin conditions are very common, and early diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and better patient outcomes. However, recognising skin disorders can be difficult due to the wide range of symptoms and physical characteristics of skin issues, as well as the lack of knowledge in some fields.  
Skin disease cases are rising in prevalence, and the diagnosis of skin diseases is always a challenging task in the clinic. Utilizing deep learning to diagnose skin diseases could help to meet these challenges. In this study, neural network is proposed for the classification of skin diseases. Since the datasets for the research consist of skin disease images, we propose image segmentation along with some pretrained models of deep learning.
 Automated skin disease classification using deep learning models can lead to quicker and more accurate diagnosis, shorter treatment periods, and better patient outcomes. The goal of this study was to develop reliable deep learning (DL) models for skin disease classification.
In this project, we propose Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained on the dataset of skin disease images as a deep learning-based approach for classifying skin diseases. Iam intend to use transfer learning strategies to improve latest models like ResNet50, Residual transformers and ResNeXt along with latest image segmentation models i.e. DeepLabV3+ model and UNET model. In both models the segmentation model which is UNET acquires good accuracy than the DeeplabV3+ model. So, I choose UNET as segmentation model and ResNet50, ResT and ResNeXt as the pretrained model to train the dataset. Segmentation along with ResNet50 model accomplished 0.92726 accuracy. Here along with accuracies I calculated validation accuracy and F1 score.  
The proposed deep learning-based method has the potential to work effectively and quickly in diagnosing skin diseases, reducing on treatment wait times and enhancing patient outcomes in comparison to traditional diagnosis methods. In conclusion, our deep learning-based system for classifying skin diseases has the potential to significantly increase the effectiveness of skin disease diagnosis.

# SKIN CONDITION

Melanoma
Skin pigment-producing cells called melanocytes are where melanoma, a specific type of skin cancer, develops. Because it spreads quickly to other organs including the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and brain, it is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Genetics and other variables may also be involved in the development of melanoma, which is mostly brought on by excessive UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds. People with pale skin, light hair, and eyes are more  likely to get melanoma, as are those who have had sunburns in the past, have compromised immune systems, or come from families where the illness has been reported.
Melanoma can be detected by changes in a mole or pigmented region of the skin's size, shape, colour, or texture, as well as by the development of additional moles or growths. Depending on the stage and location of the disease, many treatment options for melanoma may be available, such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy.


RingWorms
Tinea is a common fungal illness that affects the skin, nails, and scalp. It is also known as dermatophytosis. It is caused by dermatophytes, a kind of fungus that thrives in warm, damp settings. Tinea infections are extremely infectious and can be spread by direct contact with sick people, animals, or contaminated things.
Tinea symptoms may include:
Itching, redness, and burning of the afflicted skin
Skin scaling, cracking, and peeling
Pimples or pus-filled lumps
Hair loss or bald patches (in the case of tinea capitis, a scalp infection).
